# G Prajyoth

**AI / ML Engineer · Algorithmic Modeling · Full-Stack Systems**

I design and build production-oriented machine learning systems where model behavior, robustness, and deployment constraints actually matter.  
My work focuses on translating research-inspired ML ideas into practical pipelines, working with real-world data, and shipping systems that balance accuracy, latency, and maintainability.

## 🔬 Selected Work

### 🧠 Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Correction (AKGC)
**Focus:** Algorithmic ML · Model robustness · Research-driven systems  

**Why this exists:**  
Modern LLMs hallucinate in ways that are not easily addressed by fine-tuning alone. AKGC explores a knowledge-guided, feedback-driven correction pipeline to detect and mitigate hallucinations at inference time.

**What it demonstrates:**  
- Translating theoretical ML concepts into deployable systems  
- Designing evaluation strategies for non-trivial failure modes  
- Balancing accuracy, latency, and system complexity  

**Skills signaled:** Python, ML theory, model evaluation, algorithmic reasoning, system design

### 🏔️ Rockfall Prediction Model
**Focus:** Applied machine learning · Safety-critical prediction  

**Why this exists:**  
Rockfall events pose serious safety risks in open-pit mining, yet available prediction systems often lack robustness across varied terrain and conditions.

**What it demonstrates:**  
- End-to-end ML workflows on real-world environmental and geospatial data  
- Feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation under domain constraints  
- Translating predictive models into actionable risk signals  

**Skills signaled:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, domain awareness

### 🌐 Seeker Nexus AI
**Focus:** Full-stack AI system · Practical deployment  

**Why this exists:**  
Most AI career tools stop at keyword matching. Seeker Nexus AI explores deeper resume analysis and job matching by integrating ML logic into a usable, end-to-end application.

**What it demonstrates:**  
- Full-stack system design with AI components  
- Backend–frontend integration  
- Moving from ML logic to user-facing software  

**Skills signaled:** System design, backend + frontend integration, applied AI delivery
