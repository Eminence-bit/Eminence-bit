I am a final year engineering student specializing in AI, Machine Learning, and Web Development, passionate about building intelligent agents and next-gen productivity tools. My most notable project is a **Single Image 3D Reconstruction** system ([repo link](https://github.com/Eminence-bit/single-image-3d-reconstruction)), which demonstrates my ability to implement advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques in Python. For a deep dive, please review my [project README](https://github.com/Eminence-bit/single-image-3d-reconstruction/blob/main/README.md).

Currently, I am developing the **Proactive AI Hub**—a futuristic, locally running AI agent platform designed to anticipate user needs and unify productivity across code, emails, files, and research. The system uses a Base Agent for reasoning and multiple Sub-Agents, each fine-tuned for specific tools (e.g., Microsoft To Do, Gmail, GitHub, Google Drive, Notion). The platform prioritizes privacy (local data storage), extensibility (via MCP servers), and user engagement (gamified features, sci-fi interface).

**Key Technologies & Protocols:**
- Languages: Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
- Protocols: A2A, ACP, MCP (built several MCP servers)
- AI/ML: LLM fine-tuning (Ollama, Huggingface), single-image 3D reconstruction, agent architectures
- Web: React, Vite

**Experience:**
- Virtual Internships: Java Full Stack, Google Generative AI (AICTE) with hands-on labs and foundational exposure
- Hackathons: Multiple participations, strong team-working skills
- Communication: While reserved in casual settings, I am direct and collaborative in work/project environments

**Career Goals:**
- Short-term: Complete and launch the Proactive AI Hub as a startup
- Long-term: Build a career in AI/ML, agent systems, or web development, with openness to SDE roles if entrepreneurship doesn’t pan out
